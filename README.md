TASK : Implement Caesar Cipher
       "Create a Python program that can encrypt and decrypt text using the Caesar Cipher algorithm. Allow users to input a message and a shift value to perform encryption and decryption".

Caesar Cipher Implementation :
       This Python program allows users to encrypt and decrypt text using the Caesar Cipher algorithm. The Caesar Cipher is a substitution cipher where each letter in the plaintext is shifted a certain number of places down or up the alphabet.

How it Works :
   Encryption: To encrypt a message, each letter in the plaintext is shifted a fixed number of places down the alphabet.
   Decryption: To decrypt an encrypted message, each letter in the ciphertext is shifted a fixed number of places up the alphabet.

Usage :
 *Run the Python program.
 *Choose whether you want to encrypt or decrypt a message.
 *Enter the message you want to encrypt or decrypt.
 *Enter the shift value (the number of places to shift each letter).

Note :
 *This implementation only supports letters (both lowercase and uppercase) and ignores other characters like numbers and punctuation.
 *The shift value can be any integer. A positive value shifts the letters to the right, while a negative value shifts them to the left.
